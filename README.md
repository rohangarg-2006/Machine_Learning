# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
This project implements several fundamental Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using only NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The project covers both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, with each algorithm trained and tested on given datasets to analyze their effectiveness and performance.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values based on input features.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classifies data into discrete categories.
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: A simple feedforward neural network for more complex patterns.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A lazy learner algorithm for classification and regression.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data into groups.

## Key Features
- **Training and Testing**: Each algorithm is evaluated on various datasets for accuracy and performance.
- **Dependencies**: Implemented using only `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Fully from Scratch**: No use of external machine learning libraries, ensuring in-depth understanding of algorithm mechanics.
